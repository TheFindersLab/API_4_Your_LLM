# API_4_Your_LLM

Build a simple API for your LLMs with added security to limit unknown users.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create an API for your Language Learning Models (LLMs) with built-in access controls such as API keys and credit-based usage limits. It serves as a template for developers building secure data products.

## Features

- Expose your LLMs via a RESTful API.
- Secure access using API keys.
- Implement credit-based usage limits for users.
- Easy to extend and customize.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` for managing Python packages
- Basic knowledge of Flask or similar frameworks

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/API_4_Your_LLM.git
    cd API_4_Your_LLM
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
    ```env
    API_KEY_SECRET=your_secret_key
    ```

2. Replace `your_secret_key` with a secure random string.

### Running the API

Start the API server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

### Securing Access with API Keys

- Users must include their API key in the request headers:
  ```http
  GET /generate
  Headers:
     Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
  ```

- The server validates the API key.

## Example Endpoints

- `/generate`: Generate text using the LLM.

## Extending the Project

- Add more endpoints for advanced LLM features.
- configure the credits
- Integrate with a database for persistent user data.
- Implement rate limiting for additional security.
